# Eclipse Corrosion
### Rust edition and debug in Eclipse IDE

Corrosion is a Rust development plugin for the Eclipse IDE, providing a rich edition experience through integration with the Rust Language Server and Cargo. Available for download as a complete Eclipse package (See above), full Rust development support is just one click away.


## Download/Install

Download [The Eclipse IDE for Rust Developers Package](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/photon/r/eclipse-ide-rust-developers-includes-incubating-components). With installation of plugins required, it is the easiest way to start developing Rust projects. _Java must be installed to run this IDE_

*OR*

From a working Eclipse IDE, find [Eclipse Corrosion](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/corrosion-rust-edition-eclipse-ide) on Eclipse Markerplace ([how to install from marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=3835145))

*OR*

From a working Eclipse IDE, install from p2 repository [http://download.eclipse.org/releases/latest/](http://download.eclipse.org/releases/latest/) (or [http://download.eclipse.org/corrosion/snapshots/](http://download.eclipse.org/corrosion/snapshots/) for development builds).

## Features

## Concept

### Prerequisites

The Rustup and Cargo commands are required for accessing the language server and performing most tasks. Go into the Rust preferences and either install the commands or input their paths if not automatically found.

### Project Overview
For the **edition**, Corrosion uses the [lsp4e](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4e) project to integrate with the [Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls) and [TM4E](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tm4e) project to provide syntax highlighting in order to provide a rich Rust editor in the Eclipse IDE.

**Initialization, import and export** of projects and execution are provided by integration with `cargo` command.

**Debugging** is provided by integration with `rust-gdb`.

 > Corrosion was formerly called RedOx, but required a name change due to naming overlap with another project ([See issue #24](https://github.com/eclipse/corrosion/issues/24))
